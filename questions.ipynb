    "# Probit Maximum Likelihood\n",
    "\n",
    "In this homework you should implement the maximum likelihood estimator for the probit model. To remind you, this model is defined as follows:\n",
    "    $$\n",
    "    \\begin{align}  \n",
    "    y_i  &\\in \\{0,1\\} \\\\\n",
    "    \\Pr\\{y_i=1\\} &= \\Phi(x_i \\beta) \\\\\n",
    "    L(\\beta)   & = \\Pi_{i=1}^N  \\Phi(x_i \\beta)^{y_i} (1-\\Phi(x_i \\beta))^{1-y_i} \\\\\n",
    "    \\beta  & \\in \\mathbb{R}^k \\\\\n",
    "    x_i  & = \\text{(1,k) row vector} \\\\\n",
    "    k & = 3\n",
    "    \\end{align}\n",
    "    $$\n",
    "    \n",
    "Where $\\Phi$ is the standard Normal cdf. You should proceed as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. define a data generating function with default argument `N=10000`, generating `N` simulated data points from this model. Generate the data using $\\beta=[1,1.5,-0.5]$. The function should return a `Dict` as outlined in the code.\n",
    "1. Define the log likelihood function, $l(\\beta) = \\log(L)$\n",
    "1. Write a function `plotLike` to plot the log likelihood function for different parameter values. Follow the outline of that function.\n",
    "1. Define the function `maximize_like`. this should optimize your log likelihood function.\n",
    "1. Define the gradient of the log likelihood function and use it in another optimization `maximize_ike_grad`.\n",
    "1. Define the hessian of the log likelihood function and use it in another optimization `maximize_like_grad_hess`.\n",
    "1. Use the hessian of the log likelihood function to compute the standard errors of your estimates and use it in `maximize_like_grad_se`\n",
    "\n",
    "## Tests\n",
    "\n",
    "* The code comes with a test suite that you should fill out. \n",
    "* There are some example tests, you should make those work and maybe add other ones. \n",
    "* Please do not change anything in the file structure."

## Questions branch


* In this homework you will implement the maximum likelihood estimator for the probit model.
* Clearly there are many packaged solutions for this problem out there, which are very robust and efficient. Nevertheless it is a good exercise to try maximum likelihood out, precisely because we can compare the results to packaged solutions.
* any non-standard maximum likelihood problem you might encounter will be very similar to the steps involved here, so there is something to learn.
